Nowadays , with the development of mobile device , more and more people just use their phone to solve or record some problem. I am sure that the number of times of using mobile phone to record information is greater than that of using paper and pen. Besides, It is necessary to record daily income and outcome. So we want to develop this application.We focus on everyone who use mobile pay in daily life. We think when they check out in supermarket or get notice that someone transfer some money for them, they need to record it. 

Compared with traditional notebooks, our app is easier to record. Because we provide more format to distinguish type of income or expenses. By the way , we define some type of income or expenses such as food ,fee, entertainment and so on. User neednâ€™t input repeat words . The usage method is suitable for everyone even older. As long as you have a mobile phone with you, you can record your funds at any time.


On this project, we encountered several problems. The first is how to design this ledger. We think about how to make the ledger more in line with the current payment methods of people, such as the record of savings and credit cards in the ledger. At the same time, how to improve the user experience. Our group has discussed many times, simulated many usage situations, and improved the current version time and time again.
